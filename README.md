# Canvas Test
------------------------------------------------
Definitely just a playground for learning different aspects of HTML5's canvas element.

--------------------------------------------------
I am referencing Keith Peter's video tutorial's on Egghead.io

- Learn HTML 5 Graphics and Animation (12 lessons)

Ideally, this repository should be used only as a reference for some of the methods and techniques used with canvas.

There are some useful performance tips commented inside the javascript files.
